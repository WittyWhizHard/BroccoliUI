BROCCOLIUI LICENSE 🥦


Well, well, well. You’ve found yourself at the LICENSE file. Congratulations! Most people avoid these 
like broccoli at a childhood dinner table, but here you are—reading it. Maybe it’s procrastination, 
maybe you’re one of the few who reads the fine print, or maybe you just love green vegetables. 
Whatever the reason, welcome! Pull up a chair. Preferably a green one.


1. Introduction

This software is licensed under the BroccoliUI License because, frankly, broccoli deserves more love. 
Much like this library. Broccoli is versatile, underrated, and will make your life better... just like these 
components (at least, I hope).


2. Permissions

    - 🥦 You May:
        - Use, modify, and remix this code like it’s a trendy broccoli smoothie. Add whatever you like—CSS croutons, 
          JavaScript vinaigrette. Your kitchen, your rules.

        - Share it far and wide. Hand it out like samples of roasted broccoli at a fancy farmer’s market.
        
        - Create pull requests, bug reports, or just sprinkle some broccoli emojis in your comments. No judgment here.

    - 🚫 You May Not:
        - Blame me when your app inexplicably grows a tiny broccoli icon. (That’s a feature, not a 
          bug.)
        
        - Claim you made all of this yourself without giving credit to the original Broccoli Mastermind 
          (that’s me). We all know broccoli is best served with honesty.

        - Wrap this code in cheese sauce and try to pass it off as “broccoli cheese UI.” Come on, keep 
          it green and healthy.


3. Liability (Broccoli-Based Disclaimer)

By using BroccoliUI, you agree that broccoli is the true champion of veggies, and you acknowledge 
that I am not responsible for any unexpected side effects, including but not limited to:

    - Sudden urges to attend farmers’ markets.
    - Building apps that load with a subtle broccoli green theme (you know you want to).
    - Developers around you rolling their eyes at your vegetable puns.

Use at your own risk, much like that expired broccoli you once took a chance on.


4. Warranty Disclaimer

This library is provided “as-is.” Just like the broccoli you forgot in the crisper drawer—there are no 
guarantees. If BroccoliUI works, it’s probably a miracle of nature. If it doesn’t, well, you’re in the same 
position as someone with limp broccoli: disappointed but not entirely surprised.


5. Broccoli Clause (Pay Attention)

Found a bug? Improved the code? Or just have a fun broccoli fact to share? Consider tossing your 
contributions back into the pot. No obligations, but if you don’t, somewhere, a piece of broccoli wilts 
a little inside.

That’s it! Go forth, use this code responsibly, and remember: 
**Broccoli is love. Broccoli is life. Mac Donald is a lie**
